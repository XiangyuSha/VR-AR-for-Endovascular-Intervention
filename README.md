[Quickstart](https://github.com/airvlab/cathsim-vr/tree/xiangyu-sha#quickstart)  


## Requirements
1. Operating System: Windows
2. Microsoft HoloLens or HoloLens Emulator for the final work

## Installation
1. Download Unity Hub and Visual Studio.
2. Download MRTK toolkit.

   It is an open-source software development kit (SDK) developed by Microsoft for the development of mixed reality (MR) and augmented reality (AR).
   You can use the link [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=102778).


## Quickstart
First, set up the environment in Unity. You can see the link [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOsYerpKloY) as a reference. Then download the whole project from this github. Open Unity Hub and select 'Add' button in the upper right corner to add it. Now you can load this project and start playing.

### How to play

**1. Master Controls:** 
Two cylinders act as a master to control the movement and rotation of our guidewire.  

- Use your mouse or touchpad to drag or use other input methods to move or rotate two cylinders to control the guidewire in the desired direction.
- Be gentle and precise with your movements to avoid collisions.

**2. Avoiding Collisions:**

- Carefully navigate the guidewire through the virtual environment, avoiding contact with walls and obstacles. 
- Colliding with walls or obstacles can cause the warning, so proceed with caution.

**3. Guidelines for Safe Manipulation:**

- Keep a steady hand and maintain control over the guidewire at all times. 
- Use smooth, fluid motions to guide the guidewire through narrow passages and around corners. 
- Pay close attention to your surroundings and anticipate potential obstacles ahead of time. 
- If you encounter a tight space or difficult maneuver, take your time and adjust your approach as needed. 

**4. Collision Detection:**

- Despite your best efforts, collisions may still occur. 
- The simulator is equipped with collision detection mechanisms to alert you when the guidewire collides with objects in the environment. 
- If a collision occurs, a warning message will appear on the screen. 
- Take note of the collision warning and adjust your movements accordingly to avoid further collisions.  
- Once the guidewire is no longer colliding with the vascular model, the  warning window will disappear, and you can continue manipulating  the guidewire. 
- Press the designated "CLOSE" button if you want to close it manually.

**5. Conclusion:**

- With practice and careful attention to detail, you can become more proficient at manipulating the guidewire in the simulation.
- Remember to stay focused, patient, and attentive to ensure a successful simulation experience.

Enjoy your time in this simulator!
